Piping down the valleys wild,<br>
Piping songs of pleasant glee,<br>
On a cloud I saw a child,<br>
And he laughing said to me:
<p>
&#8216;Pipe a song about a Lamb!&#8217;<br>
So I piped with merry cheer.<br>
&#8216;Piper, pipe that song again.&#8217;<br>
So I piped: &nbsp;he wept to hear.
<p>
&#8216;Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;<br>
Sing thy songs of happy cheer!&#8217;<br>
So I sung the same again,<br>
While he wept with joy to hear.
<p>
&#8216;Piper, sit thee down and write<br>
In a book, that all may read.&#8217;<br>
So he vanished from my sight;<br>
And I plucked a hollow reed,
<p>
And I made a rural pen,<br>
And I stained the water clear,<br>
And I wrote my happy songs<br>
Every child may joy to hear.

How sweet is the shepherd&#8217;s sweet lot!<br>
From the morn to the evening he strays;<br>
He shall follow his sheep all the day,<br>
And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

For he hears the lambs&#8217; innocent call,<br>
And he hears the ewes&#8217; tender reply;<br>
He is watchful while they are in peace,<br>
For they know when their shepherd is nigh.

To the bells&#8217; cheerful sound;<br>
While our sports shall be seen<br>
On the echoing green.
<p>
Old John, with white hair,<br>
Does laugh away care,<br>
Sitting under the oak,<br>
Among the old folk.<br>
They laugh at our play,<br>
And soon they all say,<br>
&#8216;Such, such were the joys<br>
When we all&#8212;girls and boys&#8212;<br>
In our youth-time were seen<br>
On the echoing green.&#8217;
<p>
Till the little ones, weary,<br>
No more can be merry:<br>
The sun does descend,<br>
And our sports have an end.<br>
Round the laps of their mothers<br>
Many sisters and brothers,<br>
Like birds in their nest,<br>
Are ready for rest,<br>
And sport no more seen<br>
On the darkening green.

Softest clothing, woolly, bright;<br>
Gave thee such a tender voice,<br>
Making all the vales rejoice?<br>
Little lamb, who made thee?<br>
Does thou know who made thee?
<p>
Little lamb, I&#8217;ll tell thee;<br>
Little lamb, I&#8217;ll tell thee:<br>
He is called by thy name,<br>
For He calls Himself a Lamb.<br>
He is meek, and He is mild,<br>

<h3><a name="5">THE LITTLE BLACK BOY</a></h3>
<table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="8" summary="poems">
<tr><td>
My mother bore me in the southern wild,<br>
And I am black, but O my soul is white!<br>
White as an angel is the English child,<br>
But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
<p>
My mother taught me underneath a tree,<br>
And, sitting down before the heat of day,<br>
She took me on her lap and kissed me,<br>
And, pointing to the East, began to say:
<p>
&#8216;Look on the rising sun: &nbsp;there God does live,<br>
And gives His light, and gives His heat away,<br>
And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive<br>
Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday.
<p>
&#8216;And we are put on earth a little space,<br>
That we may learn to bear the beams of love;<br>
And these black bodies and this sunburnt face<br>
Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove.
<p>
&#8216;For, when our souls have learned the heat to bear,<br>
The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice,<br>
Saying, &#8220;Come out from the grove, my love and care,<br>
And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.&#8221; &#8217;
<p>
Thus did my mother say, and kissed me,<br>
And thus I say to little English boy.<br>
When I from black, and he from white cloud free,<br>
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy,
<p>
I&#8217;ll shade him from the heat till he can bear<br>
To lean in joy upon our Father&#8217;s knee;<br>
And then I&#8217;ll stand and stroke his silver hair,<br>
And be like him, and he will then love me.

Under leaves so green<br>
A happy blossom<br>
Hears you sobbing, sobbing,<br>
Pretty, pretty robin,<br>
Near my bosom.

<h3><a name="7">THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER</a></h3>
<table cellpadding="8" cellspacing="8" summary="poems">
<tr><td>
When my mother died I was very young,<br>
And my father sold me while yet my tongue<br>
Could scarcely cry &#8216;Weep! weep! weep! weep!&#8217;<br>
So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
<p>
There&#8217;s little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,<br>
That curled like a lamb&#8217;s back, was shaved; so I said,<br>
&#8216;Hush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your head&#8217;s bare,<br>
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.&#8217;
<p>
And so he was quiet, and that very night,<br>
As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!&#8212;<br>
That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack,<br>
Were all of them locked up in coffins of black.
<p>
And by came an angel, who had a bright key,<br>
And he opened the coffins, and set them all free;<br>
Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run<br>
And wash in a river, and shine in the sun.
<p>
Then naked and white, all their bags left behind,<br>
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind:<br>
And the angel told Tom, if he&#8217;d be a good boy,<br>
He&#8217;d have God for his father, and never want joy.
<p>
And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark,<br>
And got with our bags and our brushes to work.<br>
Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm:<br>
So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.

O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town!<br>
Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own.<br>
The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,<br>
Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands.
<p>
Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,<br>
Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among:<br>

Sits and smiles on the night.

Farewell, green fields and happy groves,<br>
Where flocks have took delight,<br>
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves<br>
The feet of angels bright;<br>
Unseen, they pour blessing,<br>
And joy without ceasing,<br>
On each bud and blossom,<br>
And each sleeping bosom.
<p>
They look in every thoughtless nest<br>
Where birds are covered warm;<br>
They visit caves of every beast,<br>
To keep them all from harm:<br>
If they see any weeping<br>
That should have been sleeping,<br>
They pour sleep on their head,<br>
And sit down by their bed.
<p>
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,<br>
They pitying stand and weep;<br>
Seeking to drive their thirst away,<br>
And keep them from the sheep.<br>
But, if they rush dreadful,<br>
The angels, most heedful,<br>
Receive each mild spirit,<br>
New worlds to inherit.

And there the lion&#8217;s ruddy eyes<br>
Shall flow with tears of gold:<br>
And pitying the tender cries,<br>

Saying: &nbsp;&#8216;Wrath by His meekness,<br>
And, by His health, sickness,<br>
Is driven away<br>
From our immortal day.

&#8216;And now beside thee, bleating lamb,<br>
I can lie down and sleep,<br>
Or think on Him who bore thy name,<br>
Graze after thee, and weep.<br>

Now they look abroad to see,<br>
Now return and weep for me.&#8217;

even years after the official publication date.
<p>
Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:<br>
<a href="http://gutenberg.net">http://gutenberg.net</a> or<br>
<a href="http://promo.net/pg">http://promo.net/pg</a>
<p>
These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
<p><br>
Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date. This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

as it appears in our Newsletters.

<p>
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month: 1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1&#8211;2% of the world&#8217;s population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year&#8217;s end.
<p>
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ways.

someone other than us, and even if what&#8217;s wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this &#8220;Small Print!&#8221; statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8211;TM EBOOKS<br>
This PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8211;tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8211;tm eBooks,
is a &#8220;public domain&#8221; work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the &#8220;Project&#8221;).
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the &#8220;PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8221; trademark.
<p>
Please do not use the &#8220;PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8221; trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.
<p>
To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project&#8217;s eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain &#8220;Defects&#8221;. Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
